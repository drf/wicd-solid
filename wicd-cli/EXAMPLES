Some usage examples for wicd-cli.py

Scan for new wireless networks and display them:
  python wicd-cli.py --wireless --scan --list-networks
or (same thing, short version)
  python wicd-cli.py -y -S -l

Or, you can view the networks Wicd has in its cache:
  python wicd-cli.py --wireless --list-networks

If you want to do anything with these networks, you''ll need to note the 
network ID listed on the left side of the above command.

Get the channel number from network 0:
  python wicd-cli.py --wireless --network 0 --network-property channel

Or get the BSSID, channel, and ESSID for a certain network, do:
  python wicd-cli.py --wireless --network 0 --network-details

View the available encryption templates Wicd can use:
  python wicd-cli.py --wireless --list-encryption-types

If you want to use any type of encryption, you'll need to note the number in
the left column. Then, you can use the following command to display the
required values for an encryption template (where 0 is the number you noted
from the previous command):
  python wicd-cli.py --wireless --template 0

From the above command, you'll need to note the items in the Name column. You
will need to set each of those values to use that encryption type.

Frequently you'll need to set a network property. For instance, if we wanted 
to use WPA with network 0:
  python wicd-cli.py --wireless --network 0 \
    --network-property enctype --set-to wpa

We know we need to set the key property from the --template 0 argument (above):
  python wicd-cli.py --wireless --network 0 \
    --network-property key MYSUPERSECRETWIRELESSKEY
